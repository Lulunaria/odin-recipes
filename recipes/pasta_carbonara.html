    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>The eggs, pasta water, and cheese make up the creamy sauce—there is no need to add cream to this dish. While garlic is nontraditional, you may sauté 4 or 5 minced garlic cloves with the pancetta during the last 2 minutes of cooking time.</p>
    <p>Consuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk of food-borne illness.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients (4 servings)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fine salt, for the pasta water, and more to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 ounces of freshly grated Parmigiano Regiano cheese (3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>Freshly grounded black pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 ounces of guanciale (can be replaced with diced pancetta or thick bacon)</li>
        <li>1 pound of long pasta (spaghetti, <strong>bucatini</strong>, fettucine)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add 4 quarts of water and 4 teaspoons of salt to a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and egg yolks together; add the Parmesan cheese and black pepper and whisk until well blended. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a deep sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes, or until slightly crisp. Turn off burner.</li>
        <li>Once the water reaches a boil, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook following the package instructions for al dente pasta.</li>
        <li>Remove about 1 cup of the pasta water and set it aside. Drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/2 cup of the reserved hot pasta water to the pancetta and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the drained pasta and continue to cook, stirring, for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk about 1/4 cup of the reserved hot pasta water into the egg and Parmesan cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat. Gradually add the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta, stirring and constantly tossing with tongs until the sauce is silky and clings to the pasta. Add more of the hot pasta water in order to thin the sauce, if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the pasta with extra Parmesan cheese and a generous grinding of black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
